C CITATION I T A T I 0 N Captain Charles E AO 807 103, did distinguish himself between 3 August 1950 and 14 August 1950 by meritorious achievement while part- icipating in aerial flights against invaders from North Korea. By succ- essfully completing ten (10) combat missions in F-51 type aircraft, he greatly furthered the efforts of his squadron and fightin forces of the United Nations. Captain McGee, flying at extremely low altitudes, did strafe, rocket, and bomb enemy troops, artiller- armament, and other war materiel: during these flights he was in constant danger from enemy air- craft, ground fire, and artil]ery. By display of aerona skill and intrepid aggressiveness, Captain McGee proved to be a credit to himself and to the United States Air Force. 24 Sept r 1950 ) 35 ) HEADQUARTERS 18TH FIGHTER BOMBER GROUP APO 75 SPECIAL ORDERS 30 August 1950 NUMBTR 58 ) The fol Ainn, USAF, Hq, 18th Ftr Bmr Go, APO 75, are placed on T DY for a period not to excead seven (7) days on or about 30 Aug 50 to Clark AFB, APO 74, for the purposs of visiting families residing thereat.
